# 📦 Spare Parts Inventory Forecasting

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting spare parts inventory using historical demand data. By applying time-series analysis and machine learning techniques, the goal is to predict future demand, optimize stock levels, and support data-driven decision-making in supply chain management.  

The project was developed as a client-based solution to address real-world business challenges such as stockouts, overstocking, and inefficient inventory planning. Accurate forecasting enables organizations to maintain the right balance between availability and cost, improving overall supply chain resilience.
